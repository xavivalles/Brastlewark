## DECISION
I wanted to make an application for the search, but in the end I decided to do it in web page format.

## TO START
To start I used [create-react-app].

## NAVBAR
I added the navigation bar with [react-bootstrap].

## GET DATA
To get the data I used [redux-saga], but as it was called from client, I used [redux-persist] to keep the data.

## GRID
To search for the gnomes, I chose to use the [react-data-grid] library, since I had the option to filter and sort by each of the characteristics.

## POPUP
I have created a pop-up with [react-bootsrap], so that when clicking on the grid, it will show the information most visible.
